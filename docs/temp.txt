We train an autoencoder for abnormal event detection.
 Now, we identify the abnormal events based on the euclidean distance of the custom video feed and the frames
  predicted by the autoencoder.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) 
that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled.
